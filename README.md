This blog uses, among other things: [Hakyll]; [Bootstrap 4].

[Bootstrap 4]: http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/


To-do List
----------

* Add Disqus comments.
* What should the `/blog/` page do? Redirect to `/`, now that `/` is
  the main listing page?
* The site could be made a lot prettier.
* [Pug] has replaced [Jade]; we should change to it.
* `npm` mentions that several other packages we're using are
  deprecated versions; we should update.
* Should we be using Bootstrap from its CDN? Probably not, because
  we also want to be able to develop when offline.
