About the Author
================

Curt Sampson started out as a computer hobbyist in the 1980s,
programming on machines ranging from an Apple II to a VAX 11/780
running BSD Unix. In the early 90s he became a full-time systems
administrator, co-founded an early Internet Service Provider in 1995,
and soon started doing software development professionally as well.

In 1999 he joined Blink.com, a startup building a database-driven
website for storing bookmarks. (Don't look for it; it's long gone.)
Some would consider this company unusual for having a single, combined
IT department that handled everything: project management, product
design, coding, testing, deployment, IT operations and maintenance. It
did this without specialized roles (such as "programmer," "sysadmin",
"DBA" or even "project manager") for individuals: although there
certainly were people with more knowledge in specific areas, everybody
was encouraged to understand and work on every part of the entire
system.

At Blink.com he first discovered Kent Beck's book [_Extreme
Programming Explained_][EPE] and started to implement techniques that
are now called "[agile development][agile]." He grew to be a strong devotee
of automation for testing, deployment and maintenance at Blink and at
most subsequent companies, building sophisticated test and deployment
frameworks that often ran near-production configurations on
developers' workstations.

The gains in efficiency and reliability from removing the barriers
between different IT specialities were quite clear from the start;
this idea also eventually blossomed in the Agile movement as
"[DevOps]." Curt has continued to develop a wide array of techniques
within such "barrier-free" environments that increase security and
reliability at the same time as reducing cost.

As well as the blog posts here, he's also responsible for most of the
posts on the [Starling Software blog][starling], some of which also
cover agile and DevOps techniques.
